"How different are different diffs"

The dataset of all files that have different diff output generated by Myers and Histogram can be found in the [dataset](https://github.com/yusufsn/diff-of-diffs.data/tree/master/dataset) directory.

In the dataset, we made a list of file:
1. For CI-Java projects (Metrics comparison): all files that have different identified changed lines in all commits.
2. For Apache Java projects (Comparison of the SZZ result): all files that have different identified deleted lines in all candidate bug-fixing commits before we validate them. Thus, the invalid files are also listed in the dataset.

We conducted a manual comparison on the randomly sampled files from all projects (CI-Java and Apache projects).
