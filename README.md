# Research Artifact: How Different Are Different diff Algorithms in Git?

This is a research artifact for the paper **How Different Are Different diff Algorithms in Git? Use --histogram for Code Changes**. This artifact is a data repository including (i) all 21,729 files associated with the information of project name, filename, filepath, commit identity number, parent commit identity number, and the number of different identified code changes, and (ii) 378 random sampled files for manual comparison of Myers and Histogram algorithms.

The full dataset of the files can be found in the [here](https://github.com/yusufsn/diff-of-diffs.data/tree/master/dataset).
